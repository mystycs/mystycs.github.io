When you are feeling down, Tacos will always make your day better. Due to this i decided to build a AngularJS based app which finds your nearest Taco joint. This way you can quickly and easily find that joy in your life by running to your closest taco joint.

In order to get Angular running on our Rails app, we had to use bower to intsall the AngularJS dependencies. Once that was complete, we had to create our routes in app.js.

In order to get an actual list of real Taco joints, we use Zomato.com API to fetch taco joints by location, and other data such as ratings, reviews and photos.

This was a fun app to code, especially by making it a Single Page Angular App.
