Well its been a nice run! I have finally finished my course at The Flatiron Schools Full Stack Web Development Course. Over the course I have learned everything from the basics to advanced content. Coming from a CS background and Web Development background Ruby became close to me as it was an extremely elegeant and beautiful language to code in. Most likely I will never look back at PHP again since that is where I started, especially with the Rails Framework which made creating full apps a breeze. Learning angularJS was also an interesting part of the course as it really showed how powerful frameworks can be in creating dynamic single web page apps. 

Overall I think I learned a bunch of new content, and I am definintely excited to bring my skills to the next place I find myself working at!
