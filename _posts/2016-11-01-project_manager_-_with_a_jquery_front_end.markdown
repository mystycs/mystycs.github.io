Working off my last project, I added a jQuery front end. This rails app allows users to post projects under categories and create tasks and post comments.

The biggest change to the project manager was creating a JSON backend and using AJAX to render the data. Not only did we use an AJAX GET request to render the data but we also used AJAX POST requests to add data to our backend.
